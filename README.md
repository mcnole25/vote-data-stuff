# vote-data-stuff
A collection of random interests, but vote-styled, from a data person. Most results I make aim for a couple thousand votes. Numbers made possible by Reddit & charactercounter.com/word-frequency-counter, & may vary based on region & culture.

Results I compile may not be 100% accurate. This repository is made for fun & interest.
